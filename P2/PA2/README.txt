To compile the program, type 'make' in the same directory as the Makefile and the source code.
This will generate an executable called raytracer

Then run the program like ./raytracer driver0x.txt outputfile_name.ppm
passing in the name of the driver file and a name of the image file to generate.
This will then generate a ppm image file in the same directory as the executable.

I also wrote my own driver file that us based off of the cone object called "driver04.txt"
It also uses cone.mtl
